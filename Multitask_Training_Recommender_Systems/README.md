# Multitask_Training_Recommender_System
## Introduction
It is a course assignment in CS330 Deep Multi-task Meta Learning at Stanford University in 2022. The assignment is a Recommendation System topic. The languages and relevent packages are **Python - PyTorch**. The project aims to mplement a multi-task movie recommender system based on the classic Matrix Factorization and Regression algorithms.
## Dataset
We will use movie reviews from the (MovieLense dataset)[https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/]. The dataset consists of 100K reviews of 1700 movies generated by 1000 users. Although each user interaction contains several levels of meta-data, we’ll only consider tuples of the type (userID, itemID, rating), which contain an anonymized user ID, movie ID and the score assigned by the user to the movie from 1 to 5. 
## Model
* Matrix Factorization: consider an interaction matrix $M$, where $M_{ij} = 1$ if userID has rated movie with itemID and 0 otherwise. The interaction probability $p_{ij} = \log P(M_{ij} = 1)$ is:
$$p_{ij} = u^T_iq_j + a_i + b_J$$
user vector = $u_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$, item vector = $q_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$, $a_i$ = user bias term, $b_i$ = item bias term
* Regression Model: the regression model is for predicting the rating $r_{ij}$ of (userID, itemID). Using the same latent vector representations as before, we will concatenate $[u_i,q_j,u_i∗q_j]$ and pass it through a neural network with a single hidden layer:

$$\overline r_{ij} = f_{\theta}([u_i,q_j,u_i∗q_j])$$
The multi-task setting will be set as the embedding layers for both user and item vector will be the same, and feed into two algorithms to obtain the iteraction probability and rating of user and item pairs.
## Result
